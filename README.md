I created a team profile generator by first installing inquirer for my node.js app page.  I then gave a name ID, and email adress to each of my employees (engineer, manger, and intern) and put them all in question form to appear in my terminal so I could then type my answers into the terminal.   I also asked what my engineer's Github account was and where my intern went to school and ran functions so that they would appear in the terminal as well.  Once I typed in all the answers to all my questions, an HTML file was created in my Output folder.  I also created a CSS style sheet to try and add some background color and tex color to my final team profile generator webpage.
